    npm install react-markdown 
        is a popular React component that safely renders Markdown text strings into actual React elements, which the browser then displays as HTML. It allows developers to easily create text-heavy content like blogs, documentation, or product pages using the simpler Markdown syntax instead of writing extensive JSX tags.
    
    if npm install react react-dom && npm run dev -- --force

ai urls : 
    Go to the Source
    ​: ai.google.dev.
    ​Action: Go to ai.google.dev.
    ​2. Find the "API Reference"
    ​We are writing code, so we need the Reference manual.
    ​Action: Look at the top menu bar. Click on API Reference.
    ​3. Choose "REST" (The Raw Address)

    ​Node.js / Python / Android: These are "Libraries" (SDKs). 
    They wrap the code in easy functions like genAI.getGenerativeModel().

    ​REST: This stands for "Representational State Transfer." 

    This is the Raw URL version. 

    If we want to know the actual address (https://...) that the library is calling behind the scenes, we must look at the REST documentation.

    ​Action: Click the tab that says REST.

    ​4. Find the Command (models.list)
    ​On the left sidebar, we will see a list of everything the API can do. 
    We want to see the models.
    ​Action: Click models -> list.

    ​5. Read the Definition
    ​we will see a page that looks like this:
    ​Method: models.list
    Lists models available through the API.
    ​HTTP request
    GET https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models
    ​
    ​The Method is GET (meaning "Fetch data").
    ​The URL is https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models.
    ​Why did we add ?key=${API_KEY}?

    ​The documentation tells us  that every request needs authentication. In the "Raw URL" world (REST), we pass your credentials by adding ?key=YOUR_KEY at the end of the address.

    ​So the formula is:
    ​Base Address: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
    ​Version: /v1beta
    ​Command: /models
    ​Auth: ?key=YOUR_KEY
    ​Result:
    https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=YOUR_KEY

    ​Whenever we use a new technology (like OpenAI, Spotify API, Weather API):
    ​Search for "OFFICIAL NAME API Reference".
    ​Look for the section called "Endpoints" or "REST".
    ​That is where the URLs live.




    We will build a React app that uses two different brains automatically:

        The Examiner (Gemini Flash): Fast, unlimited. It handles the back-and-forth questioning.

        The Coach (Gemini Pro): Deep, limited. It runs only when the exam ends to analyze the "Strategy."

We will use this specific instruction in our code:

"Analyze the student's language for collaboration markers. Do they use 'We' instead of 'I'? Do they mention debating? 
Do they explain why they chose an answer (Deep Strategy) or just guess (Shallow Strategy)?"
