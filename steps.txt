    We will build a React app that uses two different brains automatically:

        The Examiner (Gemini Flash): Fast, unlimited. It handles the back-and-forth questioning.

        The Coach (Gemini Pro): Deep, limited. It runs only when the exam ends to analyze the "Strategy."

We will use this specific instruction in our code:

"Analyze the student's language for collaboration markers. Do they use 'We' instead of 'I'? Do they mention debating? 
Do they explain why they chose an answer (Deep Strategy) or just guess (Shallow Strategy)?"
